🐛 Troubleshooting
Issue: City not found
Solution:

Check spelling and try using a more specific location name
Try using city name with country (e.g., "Paris, France")
Ensure the city name is in English
Issue: Network error
Solution:

Check your internet connection
Ensure wttr.in is accessible from your location
Check if a firewall is blocking the connection
Issue: Slow loading
Solution:

This may be due to network latency
The app will display an error if the request times out after 10 seconds
Try a different network or check your internet speed
Issue: Application won't start
Solution:

Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed: python --version
Install required packages: pip install requests
Check if tkinter is installed: python -m tkinter
Issue: Scrolling doesn't work
Solution:

Use mouse wheel to scroll through weather information
On trackpad, use two-finger scroll gesture
